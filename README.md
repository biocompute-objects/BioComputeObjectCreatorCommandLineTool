## Background

BioCompute is a standardized way to communicate an analysis pipeline. BioCompute substantially improves the clarity and reproducibility of an analysis, and can be packaged with other standards, such as the Common Workflow Language. An analysis that is reported in a way that conforms to the BioCompute specification is called a BioCompute Object (BCO). A BCO provides the structure that dictates what information must be present in a report. 

Additional BioCompute resources can be found [here](https://biocomputeobject.org/)

## Install

This tool's dependencies include the `jsons` package in python which can be installed with `python3 -m pip install jsons` 

Download this tool's code from github in same directory where you intend to use it or use the following command:

```
wget https://github.com/p-m-ishra/BioCompute-Object-Creator-Command-Line-Tool-/blob/master/biocompute_command_line_tool.py
```

If you would like to clone this repository: 

```
git clone https://github.com/p-m-ishra/BioCompute-Object-Creator-Command-Line-Tool-.git
```

## Usage

* Current Prerequisites
  * Pipeline must be on first line of input after script started message (E.g. after this line: `Script started on 2020-08-01 15:21:02-0400`) 
  * Pipeline must be one line long
  * Symbol after working directory must be $ or # (E.g. `pranav@laptop:~$` or `root@laptop:~#`)

Place `biocompute_command_line_tool.py` in the same directory as the output of the `script` command that recorded the computational workflow or analysis pipeline.

Then run the following command:
```
python3 biocompute_command_line_tool.py 
```

## API

## Issues

* Prompt user if they would like to change anything at the end
* User specified etag (e.g. MD5, SHA-256)
* Output to json file in valid BCO format
* Check formatting for email strings
